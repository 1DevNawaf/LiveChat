# LiveChat - Modern Messaging App

LiveChat is a modern messaging app built using Flutter that allows users to sign up and log in to chat. The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter applications. We'll be leveraging Firebase Cloud Firestore for a cloud-based NoSQL database and the Firebase authentication package to implement secure authentication methods.
